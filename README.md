ChiliGenerator
------------------------------------

You can make up the name of a chili species just by combining a dangerous place and a dangerous animal.
ChiliGenerator does this for you, so you don't have to.

The app is written in HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and Twitter Bootstrap and is hosted on Azure.

The places are based on top lists of dangerous cities/places/boroughs. The places precariousness may consist
of high murder rates per capita, social concerns, the places being warzones or exposed to higher risks of
cataclysms. No values are being put into which places I've chosen to include in this app, they're just randomly
selected from my data set.

The animals listed can sometimes seem a bit weird and not so dangerous. The animals are both of the kind with
lots of teeth and claws, the kind with potent poison and the kind which are not dangerous by themselves but
can spread deadly diseases (the mosquito is probably the animal causing the most deaths in the world due to
spreading malaria). These animals are also randomly selected from a data set consisting of top lists of the
worlds most dangerous animals.
